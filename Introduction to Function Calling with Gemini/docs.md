# Introduction to Function Calling with Gemini

This is the powerful **function calling** capability of Google's **Gemini API** in Vertex AI. It enables AI models not just to generate text, but to **invoke functions** based on user input — making your applications more intelligent, responsive, and dynamic.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the concept of **function calling** in Generative AI.
- Define and register functions that Gemini can invoke.
- Use Gemini to interpret a prompt and call the correct function with appropriate arguments.
- Handle and process the response for end-to-end AI-driven workflows.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Google Cloud project with Vertex AI API enabled.
- Access token via `gcloud auth print-access-token`.
- Basic understanding of Python or cURL (depending on your implementation choice).

## 🧠 What is Function Calling?

Function calling allows the Gemini model to:
- Analyze user intent.
- Automatically choose and call predefined functions.
- Return the function call response as part of the AI output.

It bridges the gap between natural language and **actionable logic** in your code.

## 🛠️ Key Steps

### 1. Define Functions

You'll define a schema that describes what functions the model is allowed to call, including:
- Function name
- Description
- Parameters (with types and constraints)

Example:
```json
{
  "functionDeclarations": [
    {
      "name": "get_weather",
      "description": "Get the current weather in a city",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The city to get weather for"
          }
        },
        "required": ["location"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 2. Send Prompt with Function Schema

Using Gemini, send a prompt such as:

> "What's the weather like in Mumbai today?"

The model will analyze the prompt and respond with a **function call request** like:

```json
{
  "functionCall": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "args": {
      "location": "Mumbai"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 3. Handle Function Call

Once you receive the function call, you can execute the relevant backend logic (e.g., fetch weather from an API), and return the response back to Gemini to continue the conversation.

---

## 📦 Use Cases

- Booking appointments based on user input.
- Dynamic report generation.
- Triggering workflows (email, alerts, queries).
- AI assistants integrated with backend logic.
